| ZigBee | ZigBee technology is a short-range, low-complexity, low-power, low-speed, low-cost two-way wireless communication technology. It is mainly used for data transmission between various electronic devices with short distances, low power consumption and low transmission rates, as well as typical applications with periodic data, intermittent data and low response time data transmission.|
| ZigBee Gateway | The device that integrates the coordinator and Wi-Fi functions in the ZigBee network is responsible for the establishment of the ZigBee network and the storage of data information.|
| sub-device | Routing or terminal equipment in ZigBee network, responsible for data forwarding or terminal control response.|


### Conditions

Before developing ZigBee device network, you need to understand the basic logic of TuyaHomeSDK, and have used TuyaHomeSdk to complete the basic operations such as logging in and creating a home.
