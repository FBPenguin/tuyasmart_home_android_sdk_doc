|mesh group local Id|	The local Id is used to distinguish the `unique identifier` of each mesh group in the mesh network.For example, if you want to control the devices in a group, you can send the localId command corresponding to this group to the mesh network.|
|Local Connection |	The networked device is connected via Bluetooth to control mesh and command operations|
|Gateway Connection|	The networked devices are connected through the gateway (the gateway needs to be with the device, and the distance cannot be too far) to control the mesh and command operations.|
